# Setup Student Virtual Machine

## Introduction

We need to have a good setup for all the software and tools we will be using during this training. By having one common operating system pre-configured to play with, we can focus on the training rather than trying to troubleshoot random setup issues etc.

## What are we going to cover? 

This chapter will cover the steps needed to import and connect to the Virtual Machine.
